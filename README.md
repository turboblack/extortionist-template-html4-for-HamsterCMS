# extortionist-template-html4-for-HamsterCMS

https://github.com/turboblack/HamsterCMS

This template is special without graphics to speed up work on weak PCs and slow connections, the template weighs 11kb

the template is partially backward compatible with all browsers since the late 90s, (doesnâ€™t break in IE5, but there are minor artifacts), on the hosting http://web1.0hosting.net/ you can find it in the admin panel under number 13 (not by chance).

Interesting javascript effect for content

The code is simple and clear
The template is perfect for learning HTML and maintaining a home page

To use a template, create an **with any name** folder in the **templates** folder, copy files there, open the admin panel on the hosting, select the page, and specify this template in the options.

This is what this template looks like

I invite you to visit the hosting that runs on this CMS

http://w10.host

works with both old and new technologies, and backward compatible

Enjoy your use.
